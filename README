A little chrome extenstion that makes reading the news more fun, 
by replacing an editable list of words in every webpage you browse to.

It's an implementation of xkcd.com/1288, I wrote to fiddle around 
with chrome extensions development.

Download the extension from the chrome web store - http://goo.gl/pp9oj2
